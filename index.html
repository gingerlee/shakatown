      <p>Outdoor yoga season is here 🍉... well, again almost here... </p>
      <p>Cancelling todays outdoor class due to weather (6/5)</p>
      <p>Next yoga in the park - Sunday, June 12th 🌙 9am - 10am</p>
      <p>Cliff Clemens Park 🏔 Sisters, Oregon </p>
      <p>Join me for an hour long vinyasa flow yoga class. Yoga and so much more — dynamic movements synced to breath, add some sneaky squats + core to boot! Simply, a good workout. 🤸‍♀️</p>
      <p>You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds...and most likely a fire playlist ❤️‍🔥 Led by me, Ginger Lee. ⚡️</p>

      <p>Bring a mat, blanket or beach towel for under your mat, water and sunscreen — and ideally your best puns. As always, we'll keep an eye on the weather to see if it's suitable for outdoor yoga. Feel free to text me to check (also to say hey 🤙), 503-789-8130.<p>

      <p>If you have littles, bring them along to play at the playground and around our mats as we stretch a move  — and perhaps even delightfully move and stretch with us. 🌈🌱</p>

      <p>No need to register. Pay what you can — suggested donation ($5-$15). I'm on venmo, @gingerleekretschmer 🍍</p>

      <p>All of my classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and responsible (read: trauma-informed and injury-free) — ideally a little hard, a little easy, and hopefully very enjoyable. ☮️</p>
      <p>Created with shakas & aloha by Ginger, momma to gentle Ina (5) 🌝, and rebel outlaw Oskar (2) 🤠 — and daughter to a life-long Iyengar yoga teacher, my mom! 🌴</p>
