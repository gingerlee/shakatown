      <p>Oh well, hello 2022 + warm weather! 🥑</p>
      <p>Free Yoga Outside - Sunday Mornings 9-10am 🌝</p>
      <p>Cliff Clemens Park 🏔 Sisters, Oregon </p>
      <p>Outdoor yoga season is back! Join me for an hour long vinyasa flow yoga class - where you will be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds, led by me, Ginger Lee. </p>
      <p>An added bouns is it's kid friendly, as they can play at the playground and around our mats as we stretch a move - and perhaps even delightfully move and strech with us. 🌈🌱</p>

      <p>No need to register. Bring a mat, blanket or beach towel for under your mat, water and sunscreen - and ideally your best puns. As always, we'll keep an eye on the weather to see if it's suitable for outdoor yoga, check back here or shoot me a text if you're unsure (or to just say hey 🤙), 503-789-8130. Stay tuned for our first class!<p>
      <p>Classes are totally free, and if you're wanting to give a small donation ($5-10), that's also awesome. I'm on venmo, @gingerleekretschmer 🍍</p>

      <p>All of my classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and responsible (read: trauma-informed and injury-free) — ideally a little hard, a little easy, and hopefully very enjoyable. ☮️</p>
      <p>Created with shakas & aloha by Ginger — momma to gentle Ina (5) 💕 and rebel outlaw Oskar (2) 🤠, and daughter to a life-long Iyengar yoga teacher — my mom! ❣️</p>
