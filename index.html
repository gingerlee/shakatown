        <p>Made with shakas & aloha by, Ginger — emoji <span class="star">*</span> lover 🌺</p>
        <p>All classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and inspiring — a little hard, a little easy, relaxing and hopefully v enjoyable. ☮️</p>
        <p>I offer yoga outside as community service, rooted in social justice, aiming to bring people together and inward, reflecting our best selves. I teach trauma-informed yoga with an open heart and open mind to help us all stay healthy, connected, and present.</p>
        <p>I also really just love meeting new friends, being in nature, being active. And being new to Sisters — what better way to do this than with the freedom of yoga outside? 🍍</p>
