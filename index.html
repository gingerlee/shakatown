        <p>All of my classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and responsible (read: trauma-informed and injury-free) — ideally a little hard, a little easy, and hopefully very enjoyable. ☮️</p>
        <p>Created with shakas & aloha by Ginger — momma to gentle Ina (4) 💕 and rebel outlaw Oskar (1) 🤠, and daughter to a life-long Iyengar yoga teacher (my mom!). ❣️</p>
        <p>I'm new to Sisters, born and raised on the Big Island of Hawaii 🏝, and love meeting new friends, being in nature, and simply being alive. So yes, <b>let's yoga outside!</b> 🍍</p>
        <p>And if you're still reading and like fun facts, I'm a ping pong 🏓 and emoji <span class="star">*</span> lover 🌺</p>
