        <p>Outdoor yoga season is officially here 🍉 - YAY!</p>
        <p>Next class - Sunday, July 17th 🌝 9am - 10am</p>
        <p>Cliff Clemens Park 🏔 Sisters, Oregon</p>
        <p>
          Join me for an hour long vinyasa flow yoga class. Yoga and so much
          more — dynamic movements synced to breath, add some sneaky squats +
          core to boot! Simply, a good chill workout. 🤸‍♀️
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to
          the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds...and most likely a
          fire playlist ❤️‍🔥 Led by me, Ginger Lee. ⚡️

          Bring a mat, blanket/beach towel for under your mat, water and
          sunscreen — and ideally your latest puns. As always, we'll keep an eye
          on the weather to see if it's suitable for outdoor yoga. Feel free to
          send me a text to double-check, (or to just to say, 'sup g 🤙),
          503-789-8130.

          If you have littles, bring them along to play at the playground and
          around our mats as we stretch a move — and perhaps delightfully move
          and stretch with us. 🌈🌱

          All of my classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and
          responsible (read: trauma-informed and injury-free) — ideally a little
          hard, a little easy, and hopefully very enjoyable. ☮️
