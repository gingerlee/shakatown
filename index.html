      <p>Outdoor yoga season is back, my friends! 🥑</p>
      <p>Sunday 5.29 🤸‍♀️ 9am - 10am</p>
      <p>Cliff Clemens Park 🏔 Sisters, Oregon </p>
      <p>Join me for an hour long vinyasa flow yoga class. Think beyond yoga, with dynamic movements synced to breath - squats + core to boot. Simply, a good workout. ❤️‍🔥</p>
      <p>You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds...and most likely a fire playlist. Led by me, Ginger Lee. 🌝</p>

    <div>
      <p>Bring a mat, blanket or beach towel for under your mat, water and sunscreen - and ideally your best puns. As always, we'll keep an eye on the weather to see if it's suitable for outdoor yoga. Feel free to shoot me a text if you're unsure (or to just say hey 🤙), 503-789-8130.<p>

      <p>If you have littles, bring them along to play at the playground and around our mats as we stretch a move - and perhaps even delightfully move and stretch with us. 🌈🌱</p>

      <p>No need to register. Pay what you can - suggested donation ($5-$15). I'm on venmo, @gingerleekretschmer 🍍</p>

      <p>All of my classes are intended to be welcoming, creative, and responsible (read: trauma-informed and injury-free) — ideally a little hard, a little easy, and hopefully very enjoyable. ☮️</p>
      <p>Created with shakas & aloha by Ginger — momma to gentle Ina (5) 💕 and rebel outlaw Oskar (2) 🤠, and daughter to a life-long Iyengar yoga teacher — my mom! 🌴</p>
